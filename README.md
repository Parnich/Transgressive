# Content:
- Transgressive energy that can be obtained by combining diamonds, a Nether Star, and other rare items.
- Metomorphosis tool

## Mechanics of the Metomorphosis tool operation

While holding the instrument in your hands, press R (_you can change the keys in the settings_), after that a menu opens in which you can select the instrument that the tool will become.

So far, only five tools are available:

- Sword
- Pickaxe
- Axe
- Shovel
- Hoe
